After more than 3 years as a Data Scientist, I decided to get more into Data Engineering. I will explain more about the reason behind that in a seperate post. In this post, I will focus on sharing resources that I considered specifically helpful.

There is no such thing as a typical Data Scientist. Role

# General

- Designing Data-Intensive Applications by Martin Kleppmann ([Oreilly](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/-/9781491903063/))

This book has one big disadvantage: you will feel dumb when reading the 12 chapters of this book. I read this once and there was so much too learn that I started reading it again. Definitely worth every minute!

# Data Warehouses

- The Data Warehouse Toolkit: The Definitive Guide to Dimensional Modeling by Ralph Kimball [Wiley](https://www.wiley.com/en-us/The+Data+Warehouse+Toolkit:+The+Definitive+Guide+to+Dimensional+Modeling,+3rd+Edition-p-9781118530801)

This book is in its 3rd edition from 2013. That's a long time for most tech topics, but this book gives a great overview on Data Warehousing and dimensional modelling.
